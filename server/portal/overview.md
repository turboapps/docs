## Overview

The Turbo Server Portal is a web portal where users can log in to view and launch applications. Applications can be streamed from the Turbo Application Server using the Turbo Clients or HTML5 client, or ran locally using Turbo for PC. Additionally, the portal provides API services allowing other client types to interact with the Turbo environment.

### Logging In

Portal user authentication is determined by the **Authentication Type** configured in the Turbo Server administration site.

If the server has an Authentication Type that requires users to log in with a username and password, users must provide valid credentials to access the Portal and launch applications. However, if the server has enabled anonymous access, users can access the Portal and launch applications without logging in. 

If you are a user and need to log in but do not know your username and password, contact your Administrator to retrieve your credentials.

### Installing the Turbo Client

For the best experience, it is recommended to install and use one of the native Turbo.net clients on your device. Turbo.net provides clients for all major desktop and mobile platforms.

If you do not use one of Turbo.net client applications, you can still use Turbo via the HTML5 interface in any major web browser.

* [Turbo.net for PC](https://turbo.net/download)  
* [Turbo.net for Mac](https://turbo.net/download)  
* [Turbo.net for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/turbo-net/id1394795519?mt=8)
* [Turbo.net for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.turbo.android.launcher)

If you are on a device issued by your organization, your system administrator may already have installed the necessary Turbo Client on your device.

### Browser Support

The Turbo Portal supports the latest versions of modern browsers. For the best experience, we recommend using one of the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Apple Safari
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge

Using unsupported browsers or older versions may prevent some site features from functioning as expected. Some features have additional browser requirements, which are noted in the appropriate documentation.
