## Overview

Turbo Server supports following types of applications:

- **PC applications**: Virtual applications packaged in the SVM format.
- **Native applications**: Applications installed natively on an application server.
- **Web application**: Browser based applications with a URL and potentially plugin layers.

To add applications to a workspace, refer to [Workspace Applications](https://hub.turbo.net/docs/server/administration/workspaces#workspace-applications).

Applications can be packaged using [Turbo Studio](https://hub.turbo.net/docs/studio/overview/overview.html) or imported directly from the [Hub](https://hub.turbo.net/docs/server/administration/hub#importing-repositories).
