- Application Server now supports **Windows Server 2019**.
- New Server command line interface commands for importing repositories and adding applications to a workspace.

Other improvements include:

- Allow remote applications to display Windows Logon screen messages
- Allow remote applications to display Windows session reconnect selections.
- Improved server installation and upgrade time by removing unnecessary user write permissions configuration. Temporary profiles do not require write permissions to system folders by default.
- Removal of legacy administration site UI components that were not security compliant.
- Removed redundant **Temporary Layers** setting in the application components tab.
- Clean up temporary folders generated by the web server.
- Mask SQL connection string passwords in the administration text field and logs.
- Applications added to workspaces now default to Merge User isolation.
- Application license counters are reset when the settings are changed.
- Disable application persistence by default when adding a new applications to the workspace.
- Improved compatibility of third-party storage APIs such as OneDrive when connecting behind web proxies.
- Improve portal loading speeds.
- Allow launching applications directly from the application launch page URL.
- Kerberos login method in HTML5 asks for credentials instead of using temporary profile.

This update includes fixes for the following issues:

- Corrected behavior of **Enable assembly cache** setting.
- Application servers will only subscribe to the default workspace by default to reduce initial front load after upgrade.
- Fixed server diagnostics page when loading international date time formats.
- Fixed server diagnostics log download timeout.
- Compatibility improvements for network tunneling.
- Cloud storage authentication token may not refresh behind firewall.
- Login may fail after updating server license.
- Portal footer logo positioning may overlap with application tiles.
- Incorrect input validation for **Federation** domain inputs.

### Note

The component layering as specified by the Turbo Server Portal was incorrectly ordered in previous version.

Administrators should reverse the ordering of any application components that depend on a specific component ordering.
