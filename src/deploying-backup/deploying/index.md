## Overview

Turbo.net embraces a "Package Once, Publisher Anywhere" philosophy.

Once an application has been containerized in Turbo, it can be deployed directly to desktops; streamed from an on-premises Turbo Application Server or the cloud; or pushed or streamed via major device management platforms.

This section provides instructions for deploying Turbo applications over major delivery modes.

Additional delivery methods can be implemented using the Turbo APIs.

Note that when using the Turbo HTML5 client for delivery, no client deployment steps are required -- applications launch directly within any HTML5-enabled web browser.
