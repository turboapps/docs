# Desktop Client Deployment

The Turbo Desktop Client enables direct deployment of virtualized applications to end-user machines. The Desktop Client provides three distinct deployment approaches, each designed to address specific organizational requirements and infrastructure constraints. This guide outlines the available deployment scenarios to help organizations select and implement the most appropriate approach for their environment.

## Deployment Scenarios

### Standalone Deployment
The [standalone deployment](/guides/desktop-client/standalone-client) enables direct application deployment from Turbo Hub without requiring a Turbo Server infrastructure.

• Suitable for development environments and organizations requiring direct application management with custom repository configurations while maintaining the ability to pull images directly from Turbo Hub.

### Offline Deployment
The [offline deployment](/guides/desktop-client/offline-client) scenario addresses the requirements of environments operating under network restrictions or security constraints.

• Designed for regulated industries and secure environments requiring complete network isolation, enabling pre-staged image distribution and updates without internet connectivity.

### Subscription-Based Deployment
The [subscription-based deployment](/guides/desktop-client/subscriptions) utilizes Turbo Server to provide comprehensive management capabilities and automated delivery.

• Optimized for enterprise environments requiring centralized management, automated updates, and detailed analytics through organized workspace structures.

## Implementation Considerations

The selection of a deployment approach should be based on organizational requirements:

Standalone deployment provides direct control and simplicity for environments that don't require centralized management. Offline deployment ensures secure operation in restricted network environments. Subscription-based deployment delivers enterprise-scale management capabilities when centralized control is essential.

Each deployment scenario is documented with detailed implementation steps and configuration requirements to facilitate successful deployment within your environment.
