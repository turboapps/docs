# Duo with SAML 2.0

Turbo Server can be configured to allow users to log in via Duo Single Sign-On SSO using the SAML 2.0 authentication protocol.

For prerequisites and additional information about the SAML 2.0 authentication protocol, please refer to the [SAML 2.0 Prerequisites](../../server/authentication/saml.html#prerequisites) section.

### Configure Duo

The following section describes how to integrate Turbo Server with Duo using SAML 2.0.

First, ensure that you have configured Single Sign-On in Duo Administrator per the documentation at [https://duo.com/docs/sso-generic#configure-single-sign-on](https://duo.com/docs/sso-generic "https://duo.com/docs/sso-generic").

From your Duo Administration panel, go to the **Applications > Protect an Application page**.

![Duo 1 Protect an Application](../../images/duo-1.png)

Search for **Generic SAML Service Provider** and click **Protect**.

![Duo 2 Protect Application](../../images/duo-2-protect-application.png)

You now have a new SAML Service Provider Created for the Turbo Server SSO authentication. Record the **Entity ID**, **Single Sign-On URL**, and **Single Sign-Out URL** values and click the **Download certificate** button to save the certificate file for later use.

- **Entity ID:** Turbo
- **ACS URL:** https://example.company.com/auth/saml/return
- **Single Logout URL:** https://example.company.com/auth/saml/logout

### Install SAML Signing Certificate on Turbo Hub

The SAML Signing Certificate is used by Turbo Server to ensure that the SAML response is signed by the expected identity provider. This certificate was downloaded in the previous steps and must be manually installed on the Hub server.

Login to the system where the Turbo Hub role is installed on as an administrator. Install the certificate with the following steps:

1. Select **Run** from the **Start Menu** and enter **mmc**.
2. Click on **File** then click **Add/Remove Snap In**.
3. Select the **Certificates** option then click **Add**.
4. Select **Computer account**, select **Local computer**, and then complete the dialog.
5. Click on the new **Certificates** Snap In, then click **All Tasks > Import...**
   ![Okta 14 MMC Console](../../images/Okta_14_MMC_Console.png)
6. Select **Local Machine** and click **Next**.
   ![Okta 14 Certificate Import Wizard](../../images/Okta_14_Certificate_Import_Wizard.png)
7. Select your SAML Signing Certificate and click **Next**.
   ![Okta 16 Certificate Import Wizard File Import](../../images/Okta_16_Certificate_Import_Wizard_File_Import.png)
8. Select **Place all certificates in the following store**, select **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities**, and then click **Next**.
