# Overview

Turbo Server supports following types of applications:

- __PC applications__: Virtual applications packaged in the SVM format.
- __Native applications__: Applications installed natively on an application server.
- __Web application__: Browser based applications with a URL and potentially plugin layers.

To add applications to a workspace, refer to [Workspace Applications](/server/administration/workspaces.html#workspace-applications).

Applications can be packaged using [Turbo Studio](/studio/) or imported directly from the [Hub](/server/administration/hub.html#importing-repositories).
