# Logs

The following document describes the logs generated by Turbo Server.

### Server Logs

Each Turbo Server domain server writes logs into the local file system. The Turbo Server service logs are written to the install directory's logs folder, typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\Turbo Server\Logs`.

### Client Logs

User generated Turbo client logs are written to the `%localappdata%\Turbo\Logs` folder. System generated client commands are written to the `%programdata%\Turbo\Logs` folder.

### Archiving

Turbo Server automatically archives all logs on service restart. Archives can be manually deleted by the administrator, or through the [administration website](/server/administration/domain.html#managing-a-server).

Both Server and client logs archives are written to the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Turbo Server\Logs\archives` folder.

### Web Interface

Turbo Server logs can be managed from the [administration website](/server/administration/domain.html#managing-a-server).
