The default path of the Administration Site is: `/admin`, and consists of the following links:

- **Hub**: This page lists all applications repositories on your Turbo Server. From here **Federation** can be configured to source application repositories from a master hub. **API Keys** can be defined to allow access to your hub without using a password (useful for automation, tooling, federation, and other similar scenarios).

From here **Directory Services** can be configured to import users from LDAP or Active Directory. **Authentication Method** allows you to configure how users will authenticate with the Turbo Server. **Device Keys** allows you to manage all registered devices. For more information refer to [Managing Users and Authentication](/server/administration/users).
