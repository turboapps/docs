# Overview

The following documentation describes the Files API implemented by the Turbo Server Portal. The Files API allows users to view and manage files stored in their connected cloud storage accounts. 

For more information cloud storage integrations and connecting cloud storage accounts, see:
* [OneDrive](../../server/cloud-storage/onedrive.html)
* [Dropbox](../../server/cloud-storage/dropbox.html)
* [Google Drive](../../server/cloud-storage/google-drive.html)
* [Filr](../../server/cloud-storage/filr.html)
* [File Share (SMB)](../../server/cloud-storage/file-share.html)
* [End User Guide](../../server/cloud-storage/end-user.html#end-user-guide) 

All request paths described in this document are relative to the base Portal URL: `https://{portal}`

### Authorization

All requests expect an `X-Turbo-Ticket` header with a JWT access token value. If this token is missing or invalid, a **401** unauthorized response error is returned.

### Request and response formats

#### **Date format**

All dates returned by the Files API are in UTC time and ISO 8601 format:

`2015-05-15T15:50:38Z`

#### Resource Address Format

File resources are uniquely located by their resource address. The resource address is formatted in standard unix path formatting (ex. `/my-onedrive/path/to/file.txt`). The root path segment is the storage provider slug, which identifies the remote storage provider that contains the resource, and the remaining path segments are the resource address within the remote storage provider.

The Files API metadata object include the resourceâ€™s address in its **address** field. Resource addresses should be used as-is and should not be manually altered or created.

The root folder is addressed by an empty string or `/`.

### Errors

The Files API errors return an error status code in addition to a JSON object in the response body with additional details.

The following section describes the various error responses that should be handled by consuming clients.

#### 400: Bad Request

A 400 error response indicates that the provided arguments were invalid or the requested operation failed. For example:

- A required header or JSON body was not provided
- An invalid header or JSON body was provided
- The supplied arguments resulted in an endpoint-specific error, such as an missing resource, path conflict, incorrect file type, etc.

For example, a list-folder request with an address that does not point to a file or folder would return a 400 error with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "code": "itemNotFound",
  "message": "The resource could not be found."
}
```

The message may also contain additional information about the error. To resolve this issue, check the error response and adjust your arguments accordingly.

#### 401: Unauthorized Response

A 401 error response indicates that the user is not authorized to access the requested file or folder. This occurs when then user did not provide a valid ticket.

For example, a get-metadata request with an expired ticket would return a 401 error with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "code": "unauthorized",
  "message": "The caller is not authenticated."
}
```

To resolve this issue, check the error response and adjust your provided authentication header accordingly.

#### 5xx: Server Error

A 5xx error response indicates that an unexpected error occurred while processing the request.

5xx errors are not guaranteed to return a JSON response body.

### Examples

#### Download all files to a local folder

The following C# console application demonstrates how a client can iterate through a user's connected cloud storage providers and download all files and folders to a local folder:

```
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
