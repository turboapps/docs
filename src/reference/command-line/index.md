# Command Line

The Turbo command line interface (CLI) is accessible from the Windows command prompt using the `turbo` command.

The Turbo CLI provides programmatic access to all major Turbo functions and can be used, for example, to automate processes or interface with third party products.

The Turbo CLI is installed as part of any of the Turbo Client, Turbo Server, and Turbo Studio setups.

This section provides a general reference for all Turbo CLI commands. For details on using the CLI for specific purposes (eg for automated desktop deployments or SCCM integration), see the appropriate section in the Turbo documentation.
