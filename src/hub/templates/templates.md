## Templates

Templates provide a way to build your own application environment. Tell Turbo what type of application you're building and the dependencies it needs, and we'll deliver a base container embedded with the proper images.

For example, let's say you've written a JavaScript web application on Node.js and MongoDB. Instead of installing these and forcing your testers or end-users to install these dependencies as well, you can build a portable container for your project by adding your application to a template with Node.js and MongoDB images pre-packaged.

Once you package your application into that container, you can deploy it to any Windows environment for testing or use without installers, missing dependencies, or breaks.
