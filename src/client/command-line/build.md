# build

The `build` command is used to automate the creation of images. The `build` command can build images from a TurboScript or a **.xappl** configuration file.

```
Usage: turbo build <options> <path>

<options> available:
      --diagnostic           Enable diagnotic logging
  -e, --env=VALUE            Set environment variables inside the container
      --env-file=VALUE       Read in a line delimited file of ENV variables
      --format=VALUE         Use json format for output
      --mount=VALUE          Mount a host folder into the container. Format: [other-container:]SourceFolder=TargetFolder
  -n, --name=VALUE           Name of the image
      --no-base              Do not merge the base image into the new image
      --overwrite            Overwrite existing image
      --route-file=VALUE     Specify a routing rules file
      --vm=VALUE             The Turbo VM version to run the container with
      --wait-after-error     Leave program open after error
      --wait-after-exit      Leave program open after it exits
```

To build an image from an existing container, use the `commit` command.

## Working with Dependencies

### Base Images

Newly created images are usually based on existing images. For example, a WordPress image is based on PHP, MySQL, and Apache images. There are two ways to handle these dependencies:

#### Default Behavior
By default, all base images are baked into the new image. The newly created image includes everything it needs.

For information purposes, the used images will show up in the Hub under the Dependencies tab of the repository.

#### Runtime Dependencies
If an image is created with the `--no-base` option, the newly created image will not contain the base images. Instead, the images are downloaded and loaded when the image is used.

For example, with a WordPress image based on PHP, MySQL, and Apache built with `--no-base`:
- When launched, the PHP, MySQL, and Apache images are downloaded
- Transitive dependencies are downloaded recursively
- The image cannot be pushed if base images are not available on Hub

### Using TurboScript

A TurboScript is a list of instructions that Turbo will follow to create a container. After the last instruction in a script, Turbo will automatically run `turbo commit` on the recently created container, creating a new image.

When building from a **.me** script, Turbo will take the following steps: 

1. Create an empty container from all of the base images specified in the `from` instruction -- this is equivalent to `turbo run <image>`
2. Perform the remaining instructions in the newly created container 
3. Commit the container to a new image
4. Remove the container from the local machine

If there are any conflicts between a TurboScript instruction and a command-line flag then the TurboScript instruction will take precedence.

### Using .xappl Files

A **.xappl** file is an XML file that contains all of the filesystem, registry, and configuration information for a given image. A **.xappl** file can be built using Turbo Studio.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be added to the container through the `-e` or `--env-file` flags. These environment variables are initialized at container creation and thus may be overridden by variables created with the `env` instruction in the build script. 

To create multiple environment variables in the container, use multiple `-e` flags. For example, the following command would add two environment variables, VAR1 with value 1 and VAR2 with value 2, to the built image. 

```
> turbo build -e=VAR1=1 -e=VAR2=2 C:\TurboScript
```

Alternatively, use the `--env-file` flag and specify all of the environment variables you wish to add to the image in a line-delimited text file. For example, the previous command could be replicated using the following command: 

```
> turbo build --env-file=C:\env-vars.txt C:\turbo.me
```

where **env-vars.txt** has the contents: 

```
VAR1=1
VAR2=2
```

**Note**: If the `--env-file` and `-e` flags are used in the same command, the `env-file` flag is always processed before the `-e` flag. In the case of a conflict, the `-e` flag always takes precedence. 

### Other Command Line Flags

Name images using the `-n` flag and overwrite existing images with the same name using the `--overwrite` flag. 

```
> turbo build -n=my-new-image C:\turbo.me
...
Output Image: my-new-image

# Try to build the same image second time
> turbo build -n=my-new-image C:\turbo.me
Error: The image already exists. You can overwrite with the --overwrite flag

# Try third time, with --overwrite flag
> turbo build -n=my-new-image C:\turbo.me --overwrite
...
Output Image: my-new-image

# Tags can be optionally added to the -n flag
> turbo build -n=my-new-image:1.0 C:\turbo.me
...
Output Image: my-new-image:1.0
```

The build command will create the intermediate container and output image using the latest version of the **Turbo VM**. To use a legacy version, specify the version number you wish to use with the `--vm` flag. 

```
# Build the image using version 11.6.205 of the Turbo VM
> turbo build --vm=11.6.205 C:\turbo.me 
```

The `--diagnostic` flag enables logging within the intermediate container. This flag does not create diagnostic-mode images.

### Merging Images

The `build` command will include all images, which are referenced with the `from` statement in the script. For example, when the script uses `from spoonbrew/git, spoonbrew/nuget`, then these two containers will be merged and stored into the newly built container.

The `--no-base` option will not merge in the script. Instead, the images are included at runtime. This is useful when:
- You want to reduce the final image size
- Base images are frequently updated
- You need flexibility in base image versions
- Testing different dependency combinations

### JSON output

When `--format=json` option was passed this command will provide output in JSON format. It will contain either an `image` object with information about result image or an `error` object if command failed.
