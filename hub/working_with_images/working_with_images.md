## Working with Images

### Creating Images

There are four ways to create an image:

1. Commit a container
2. Automatically create with a build script
3. Build images from XAPPL configuration files created with Turbo Studio
4. Import and convert various file types to images

#### Commit a Container

```
# Before committing a container check that it is stopped
> turbo containers

# Then create a new image from the container
> turbo commit <container-id> <image-name>
```

See a more detailed example [here](/docs/studio/working-with-containers).

#### Automatic Builds

You can automatically build images using a TurboScript, which is a set of instructions that recreate the steps of configuring a container. See more information on [TurboScript](/docs/reference/turboscript) verbage and syntax.

```
# Example script to automatically build a 7-Zip image

# Pull dependency images
layer gnu/wget

# Prepare environmnet
cmd mkdir c:\7zip

# Download installation media
workdir C:\7zip
cmd wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z920.exe

# Install 7-Zip
cmd 7z920.exe /S /D=C:\7zip
```

Save the script as a .me file and then use `turbo build` command:

```
# Build the script and specify a name for the new image
> turbo build -n=7-zip:9.20 C:\path\to\build.me

# New image is now saved in the local registry
> turbo images

Name   Tag   ID            Created               Size
7-zip  9.20  95sdf1245239  8/18/2014 2:21:32 PM  25.4MB
```

#### Building from a XAPPL File

XAPPL files are static configuration files originally created using Turbo Studio that specify the files, registry keys, and virtual machine settings for an image. The command-line interface can also build images based on XAPPL configuration files using `turbo build` command.

```
# Build an image and specify a name
> turbo build -n=firefox:30 C:\path\to\firefox30.xappl
```

#### Import

If you have an existing image (file type `.svm`) on your local machine or a network drive (perhaps built with Turbo Studio or a legacy version of Turbo Studio), you can import it to your local registry.

```
# Specify the new name, file type, and path to the image
> turbo import -n=newimage svm C:\path\to\image.svm
```

If the image is not explicitly named, its ID will be used as a default.

The `import` command also supports building from 2 external file types:

1. Microsoft Software Installer (`.msi`)
2. ThinApp Configuration (`package.ini`)

Use the appropriate file type parameter:

```
# MSI
> turbo import msi <path to .msi>

# ThinApp configuration
> turbo import thinapp <path to package.ini> 
```

### Forking, Renaming, and Tagging

Images can be forked using the `turbo fork` command. This creates a link to the specified image with a new name and tag. It does not affect the original image.

```
# Pull an image
> turbo pull account/image

# Check the image
> turbo images

Name            Tag  ID            Created               Size
account/image        14wed2165141  8/18/2014 1:55:23 PM  1.9MB

# Fork to a new image name and tag
> turbo fork account/image tester/test1:1.0

# New image is added
> turbo images

Name            Tag  ID            Created               Size
account/image        14wed2165141  8/18/2014 1:55:23 PM  1.9MB
tester/test1    1.0  14wed2165141  8/18/2014 1:55:23 PM  1.9MB
```

The `turbo tag` command can also retag images.

```
# Specify the image you want to tag and the new tag
> turbo tag tester/test1:1.0 2.0

# Check the tag
> turbo images

Name            Tag  ID            Created               Size
account/image        14wed2165141  8/18/2014 1:55:23 PM  1.9MB
tester/test1    2.0  14wed2165141  8/18/2014 1:55:23 PM  1.9MB
```

### Push to a Remote Repository

Images in a local registry can be copied to a remote repository on the [hub](/hub) with the `turbo push` command to make your images available to your team members, end-users, or the public.

```
# Specify the image you want to push
> turbo push sample

# Or push to a specific namespace and tag
> turbo push turbotest/sample:latest
```

If unspecified, the image will be pushed to the logged-in user's namespace with the tag head.

For basic users, pushed images will be public by default. For paid users, pushed images will be private by default until the private repository limit is reached. Visit [the hub](/hub) to change these defaults.

See more information on [using the hub](/docs/hub).
