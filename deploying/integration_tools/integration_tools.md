## Integration Tools

Turbo has tools to enhance the deployment process and integrate containerized applications with existing deployment tools. For example, Browser Redirector enables administrators to automatically direct users to a supported browser based on a URL that is entered. This solves compatibility issues for organizations that have legacy web applications that rely on non-standard browser configurations. 

Another integration tool, SpoonReg, provides a way to register the virtual applications to the Windows shell and create file associations and desktop shortcuts.
