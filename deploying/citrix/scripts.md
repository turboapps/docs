### Using Turbo Citrix Scripts

Turbo containers can also be deployed to XenApp using powershell helper scripts to automate the deployment.

#### XenApp 7

For XenApp 7, use the **turbocitrix/xa7-subscribe** container image to add turbo applications to your XenApp server and publish them automatically.

```
# install the turbo client for all users on the machine (this is only necessary once)
> Turbo-Plugin.exe --all-users --silent

# login to your account or org using the defined API key
> turbo login --api-key=WvUjfpjqtx0as1CczTX5mPZ5pdXgc1w2t91HRzVc3Qc 
Logged in as turboorg

# run the container image that contains the powershell helper script
> turbo try turbocitrix/xa7-subscribe -- turboorg -deliveryGroup Default -apikey WvUjfpjqtx0as1CczTX5mPZ5pdXgc1w2t91HRzVc3Qc -waitonexit
