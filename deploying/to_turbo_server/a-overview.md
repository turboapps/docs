## To Turbo Server

Turbo Server is an application deployment platform that enables you to launch applications instantly from websites, portals and client desktops (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, or any HTML5 browser). Unlike traditional deployment methods, applications streamed from Turbo Server do not require download, installation, rebooting, administrative privileges, or separate setup steps. Turbo Streaming Server allows you to host an application portal for your users. Turbo Streaming Server can source applications from turbo.net hub or onpremise from Turbo Hub Server.

### Overview

#### Technology

##### Turbo Containers

Unlike other virtualization solutions that require an entire copy of the host operating system, Turbo's container technology only emulates the features required to run application. Turbo containers have the same performance characteristics as native applications, but without any changes to system infrastructure.

The core of Turbo Virtualization Technology is the Turbo Virtual Machine (VM) kernel. Occupying less than a few megabytes of storage and almost zero performance overhead, Turbo kernel is a lightweight implementation of core operating system APIs, including file system, registry, process, and threading subsystems. Turbo kernel is implemented entirely within the user-mode space, meaning Turbo applications can run without any driver installation or administrative privileges.

Turbo containers interact with a virtualized file system, registry, and process environment contained in the kernel, rather than directly with the host device operating system. Requests are handled internally within the virtualized environment, but can also be redirected or overridden based on your configuration.

##### Turbo Streaming

Turbo Streaming Server allows an application to be executed in an application server pool while streaming the application to the client machine. Native clients are supported for Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android or any HTML5 browser can be used to access the application. Using Turbo Container technology on your application servers allows for increased user density and less maintenance than traditional remote desktop solutions.

#### Features

Turbo Server enables you to accomplish the following goals:

- Host containers on the web. You can stream Turbo containers from the Turbo Streaming Server portal site, custom external sites via HTML, or third-party collaborative web portals such as Microsoft SharePoint, IBM WebSphere, and Novell Teaming.

- Provide your organization with a single access point to your application portfolio. Instead of moving desktop-to-desktop to upgrade or install software, you can publish an application to Turbo Streaming Server's portal site; this provides licensed end-users with immediate access and full functionality.

- Launch applications faster over the Internet and intranets. Streamed applications launch immediately without the need to download. Turbo Streaming does not require any special ports or proprietary protocols.

- Empower a mobile workforce. Turbo containers require no installation or administrative privileges, meaning they can launch from anywhere, even on secure, locked-down desktops such as airport and hotel kiosks.

- Run multiple versions of applications side-by-side without conflicts or dependencies. Turbo containers run in isolated sandboxed environments. This enables you to avoid conflicts and dependency issues associated with natively-installed applications.

- Migrate with confidence to Microsoft Windows 10. Turbo enables you to run legacy applications as they stand on newer operating systems, including Microsoft Windows 7 and 8/8.1, without the need to recode, retest, or reinstall.

#### Supported Platforms

Turbo Server is compatible with the following platforms:

- Microsoft Windows Server 2016
- Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2
- Microsoft Windows Server 2012
- Microsoft Windows 2008 R2
- Microsoft Windows 10
- Microsoft Windows 8.1
- Microsoft Windows 8
- Microsoft Windows 7 (all editions)

Turbo Server supports x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit) processor architectures. End-users can access Turbo Server from Microsoft Windows 10, Microsoft Windows 8.1, Microsoft Windows 8, and Microsoft Windows 7 platforms. Turbo Streaming Server portal supports Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, and all other HTML5 browsers.

**Note:** Versions of Internet Explorer prior to Internet Explorer 8 are not supported. If you are accessing the Portal Site with a newer version of Internet Explorer, but experiencing problems, be sure to disable compatibility mode. This feature is enabled automatically for intranet sites and serves to emulate Internet Explorer 7 which is not supported by the Portal Site.
