### Turbo Hub Server Administration

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-1.png)

The Turbo Hub Server Administration Site enables you to manage and control all aspects of your Turbo Hub Server. 

The default location of the Administration Site is: http://localhost:81, and consists of the following links:

- **Hub**: This page lists all applications repositories on your Turbo Hub Server. From here **Federation** can be configured to source application repositories from turbo.net hub. **API Keys** can be defined to allow access to your hub without using a password (useful for automation, tooling, and other similar scenarios). If connecting to a Turbo Streaming Server, the dashboard namespace and display name can be defined here as well.

- **Users**: This page provides a list of active and inactive users on your Turbo Hub Server. For more information refer to *Managing Users*.

- **Reports**: This page provides preconfigured customizable analytics reports, sorted according to Administration, Hub, and Users. For more information refer to *Reports*.

- **Admin**: This page contains a summary of your Turbo Server license, and information and options for configuring Turbo Hub Server. For more information refer to *Configuration and Customization*.

#### Manage Hub

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-2.png)

All application repositories on Turbo Hub Server are managed from the **Hub** page of the Administration Site. 

##### Application Repositories

Each new application repository is added to Turbo Hub Server in the form of a Turbo container image, or SVM, which are pushed to the hub using the Turbo Client command line tools.  For more information about SVMs and Turbo Virtualization Technology refer to *Turbo Hub Server Technology*.

##### Adding a Container Image

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-11.png)

Complete the following steps to add a new application image to Turbo Hub Server:

1. Install the Turbo Client for Windows platform.

2. Connect the client to your hub server using the `turbo config` command. See [Config Command](/docs/reference#config) for more information.

```
> turbo config --hub=http://[hubserver]
```

3. Log in as a hub administrator account or use a **system** API key. This is done using the `turbo login` command. See [Login Command](/docs/reference#login) for more information.

```
> turbo login admin-user
-OR-
> turbo login --api-key=6g8BwsIlU7ezl_CMIZ_0PYBwK6WVAUZdx1mxYO1WFOg
```

4. Create your container image. See [Building Containers](/docs/building) for more information on ways to create container images.

As an example, we will make a create an empty container that executes the native notepad.exe application.

```
> turbo new clean -n=test-container
(exit the container window that is shown)
> turbo commit test-container test/notepad:1.0 --no-base --startup-file=notepad.exe
> turbo push test/notepad:1.0
```

You will now see your test image in your hub list in the administration site. This image will be accessible to all users who are defined to have access to the hub server. 

**NOTE:** If you do not specify a namespace in the image name (ex, "test" in "test/notepad") then the image will be pushed to the user's private namespace. This image will only be accessible by the user who pushed it and it will not show in the hub list on the administration site.

##### Managing Repositories

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-7.png)

On the repository edit page, a repository display name can be modified. This shows up in the hub administration page list as well as in connected Turbo Streaming Server portals if the dashboard is configured to show that repository. The repository ID field cannot be modified and is assigned when the first container image is pushed to the hub. The **versions** list shows all available images that are available for this repository. They can be referenced by their tag or their ID (ex, "mozilla/firefox:64.0" or "mozilla/firefox#44397e23bf46a08a8a567ba13b2c215668d451c9dde41b030706779dc977cc02"). Accessing a repository without a tag or ID will use the latest available image (ex, "mozilla/firefox"). Note that any repository updates may take up to 24hrs to be automatically retrieved by the Turbo Client.

##### Managing Repository Federation

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-6.png)

With the Federation feature in Turbo Hub Server, you can configure application repositories to be sourced and automatically updated from the Turbo.net Hub. Since repositories in the Turbo.net Hub are automatically built as updates become available, you can remove the burden of maintaining images yourself.

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-6.png)

When first using Federation, you must configure the API key that is used to access the Turbo.net Hub. This API key can be retrieved in your [Turbo.net Account Settings](https://turbo.net/settings/devices-and-api-keys). You can also set how frequently the Turbo.net Hub is queried for new version of federated repositories. The default frequency is every 24-hours. If **Automatic Forwarding** is enabled, any image request to your hub instance that cannot be satisfied will automatically be forwarded on to Turbo.net Hub with the returned repository being cached in your hub. This effectively federates the entire Turbo.net Hub library and uses your instance as a local cache for your users.

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-5.png)

To add a new federated repository, click the **Add Repo** button and enter the full name of the Turbo.net repository that you want to federate. Set the **Revision History Length** field to the number of past revisions to import during a sync. Since repositories on Turbo.net are updated automatically, some may have hundreds of images available. The default value is 10 revisions. After setting the properties, click **Save**. You will now see your new federated repo listed and the initial sync with Turbo.net Hub will be in progress. After the sync is complete you will see the new repository in your main repository list on the Hub administration page.

##### Managing API Keys

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-9.png)

API Keys allow you to login to your hub with a code other than with a username/password. This is useful when configuring automation or in other scenarios where a plain text password is not desirable. If an API Key has been compromised, it can be refreshed to a new value or deleted to immediately revoke access. 

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-8.png)

When adding an API Key, give it a name that describes the general usage of the key. It is also recommended to have distinct keys for distinct usages so that if one is compromised or updated, all usages will not require update. **Run as System** controls whether the key is given administrative priviledges to push new images or delete repositories. Without this setting, the API key will only have read access to repositories.

##### Managing the Dashboard

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-10.png)

When connecting Turbo Streaming Server to your Turbo Hub Server, the portal displays applications which are defined in your hub's dashboard. For example, if you dashboard is defined as "test-dashboard", then all repositories in that namespace ("test-dashboard/firefox", "test-dashboard/chrome", etc) will be displayed in the Turbo Streaming Server portal. All other containers will not be visible although they are still accessible as dependencies to visible applications.

#### Manage Users

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-12.png)

Turbo Hub Server users are tracked and managed via the Administration Site. Users are entered manually or via automated import from LDAP or Active Directory directory services. Users can be viewed and managed on the **Users** page. You can also place users into groups. The **Users** page contains a list of existing users and user groups. From this page you can view user directories, status, and available actions. Displayed above the user list is the total number of licenses available and the number of licenses currently in use.

##### Managing Users

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-13.png)

To manage a user, select the user name from the list on the **Users** page. The following fields are displayed on the page:

- **Name**: Full name of the user.

- **Login Name**: The unique login name for the user.

- **Directory Information**: Information about the directory service for the user if the user was imported from an external directory service.

- **Enabled**: Determines whether a user can access Turbo Hub Server. After a user is disabled he no longer consumes a seat.

##### Managing User Groups

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-14.png)

To create a user group select **Add Group**. The **Add User Group** screen displays. This screen contains the following fields:

- **Name**: The group name that displayed on the user screen.

- **Description**: A group description (optional).

- **Members**: Users and groups that are members of this group. Users and groups are inherited when including other groups as members. Add users or other groups by selecting Add.

There are two special groups that are created automatically, **Administrators** and **Anonymous Users**. Any users in the **Administrators** group will be able to log into the administration site and push shared images. Note that changes to the **Administrators** group will require a service restart before they are honored by the hub services. Access to the administration site will be honored immediately. Users discovered when the authentication mode is set to **Anonymous** are added to the **Anonymous Users** group. 

##### Adding an External Directory Service

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-15.png)

Using Turbo Hub Server you can add an external directory service, such as Active Directory. This enables you to manage users with the touch of a button and easily import existing users and groups into Turbo Hub Server. Complete the following steps to add an external directory service:

1. Open a Turbo Server administration site page in your web browser.

2. Choose the **Users** category from the top navigation bar.

3. Select **Manage Directory Services**.

4. Select **Add Service**. The **Add Directory Service** screen displays.

5. Enter your specific settings into Turbo Server. Each section is detailed below.

**Note**: When synchronizing external directory-services containing of over 5,000 users, the command-line administration utility should be used instead of the Administrator web site. For more information on using the administration utility, see *Manage Turbo Server from the Command Line*.

**Choosing Your Connection Settings**

Complete the following steps to choose your connection settings:

1. Enter the settings for the **Server** section. The **Host**, **Port**, and **Top directory** are initialized with typical values, but you can customize them to match your directory service settings. They are best discovered using the management tools for the application that hosts them, such as *Microsoft Windows* or *Apache Directory Services*.

	- The **Top directory** should be specified to avoid potential login issues that are difficult to troubleshoot.

2. Set the **Binding Type**. Changing the **Binding Type** will change the **Port** to the standard LDAP port number for that setting, if you have not specified another port number.

	- Choosing the **Simple** binding type is not recommended if you are binding to Active Directory, but it can be useful while on the page in diagnosing connection problems via the **Test** button.

3. Enter your credentials at the **Synchronization Account** section. To connect with a specific account in the **Synchronization Account** section, specify the username:

	- **Active Directory**: The domain login (e.g. acme\aaron)

	- **Generic LDAP**: The distinguished name (e.g. uid=aaron,ou=acme,ou=system)

4. To test these settings, click on the **Test** button.

5. Once the test is successful, proceed to the **Directory Schema** section.

**Directory Schema**

Directory schema settings are customizable within any directory service; you can change these settings to match the names in your directory service. The most common schema values are tried by selecting **Discover**. You can select **Discover** when you are not satisfied with the result in the **Synchronized Directories** section. Complete the following steps to use the **Discover** functionality:

1. Select **Refresh** from the **Synchronized Directories** section and inspect the results. If the users and groups shown there are accurate, leave the directory schema settings as they are.

2. If the **Synchronized Directories** does not accurately depict the users and groups you expect, select **Discover** and wait for the schema settings text boxes to fill with the recommended values. Test these values at any time from using **Refresh** in the **Synchronized Directories** section.

3. If you know the correct schema name for the given properties, you can enter it manually. If there are more than one name for the same value you can  enter each name separated by a semicolon. Each is searched during synchronization.

4. To reset the settings to the Turbo Server default, select Defaults.

**Choosing Items to Synchronize**

You may limit the scope of users and groups that will be synchronized from your directory service, either by choosing specific directories within the service, or by selecting the user groups in which you are interested.

*Choosing directories*

Your directory service might contain some subdirectories that have useful information and others that contain unwanted information. You can choose which subdirectories to synchronize using **Synchronized Items**, selecting the **Directories** option. Complete the following steps to use **Synchronized Items**:

1. Select **Refresh** to use the current connection and directory schema settings to scan your directory service. Information about discovered sub-directories is available via **tooltip popups**. For large directories this operation can take several seconds to complete.

2. To narrow the scope of your synchronization to specific directories complete the following:

	a. Uncheck **Include All**.

	b. Check directories to include.

*Choosing groups*

You may have a specific subset of existing users that will use Turbo Server, in a group or groups native to your directory service. You can choose which groups to synchronize using **Synchronized Items**, selecting the **Groups** option. Complete the following steps to use **Synchronized Items**:

1. Select **Refresh** to use the current connection and directory schema settings to scan your directory service. Information about discovered group is available via **tooltip popups**. For large directories this operation can take several seconds to complete.

2. To narrow the scope of your synchronization to specific groups complete the following:

	a. Uncheck **Include All**.

	b. Check groups to include. All members of that group will be synchronized, including contained groups and all of their members.

When you are satisfied with your settings, select **Save**. At this point, the users and groups in your directory service are not synchronized with Turbo Server. From the **Manage Directory Services** page, click the synchronization button and verify there are positive counts for users and/or groups when it has finished. For large directories this can take several seconds.

#### Reports

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-16.png)

#### Configuration and Customization

![](/docs/deploying/to_turbo_server/hub-admin-18.png)

The **Admin** page provides options to configure and customize Turbo Hub Server. The page is divided into the following sections:

- **License**: Provides an overview of information associated with the current Turbo Server license, including number of seats, allowed portals,  computer name, and machine identifier. If server users are licensed to run applications on more than one machine, this number is reflected here. This section also contains a link to add a **New License**; you can use this to update an existing license as well.

- **Administrator Email**: Users are directed to this email address if they encounter any errors or issues while using Turbo Hub Server.

- **Administrators**: The administrative web pages can be restricted to a subset of the users known to the Turbo Hub Server. If no users are contained in this group, access will be open to anyone able to access the port of the administration site. When at least one user is contained in the group, a login form is presented to any user who hasn't already been authenticated from his browser. Only the members of the administrators group (including members of groups that are members of the administrators group) are allowed access. Note that this group appears in the standard user groups list and is editable from there as well. 

- **Authentication Type**:  Authentication type that users must supply to access applications.
