The October 2020 update to Turbo Client includes fixes for the following issues:

- Windows Defender Compatibility issue that could result in an intermittent **Could not load assembly** error message.
- Cloud Windowed execution mode is now multimonitor DPI aware. This resolves an issue where streamed windows could be restricted to a small area of a monitor.
- Command line **gci** command **--trial** flag more accurately reports the number of images to be removed.
